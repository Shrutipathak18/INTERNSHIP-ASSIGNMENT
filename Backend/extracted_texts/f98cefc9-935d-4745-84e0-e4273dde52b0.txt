Cover Letter 
Dear Hiring Manager, 
I am writing to express my interest in a frontend development or full-stack development role at 
your organization. As a final-year B.Tech student in Electronics and Computer Science at KIIT 
University with a CGPA of 8.08, I have consistently blended academic learning with hands-on 
project development and team leadership. 
During my time as a Tech Team Member at KIIT E-Cell, I had the opportunity to coordinate 
technical events like Smart India Hackathon 2023 and Internship Camp 2023, strengthening 
my ability to manage real-world projects under pressure. Later, as Senior Executive of Public 
& Corporate Relations, I led the “Blind Pitch” segment at the flagship E-Summit, gaining 
valuable experience in communication, event leadership, and problem-solving. 
My project experience ranges from building a fully responsive e-commerce website (Sadak 
Shoe) to creating an intelligent retail assistant (CartMapper) using React.js, Material-UI, and 
QR-based mapping. I’ve also worked on a Flask-based database management system that 
included secure user authentication and document sharing. These projects reflect not only my 
technical proficiency in JavaScript, Python, React, and Flask, but also my commitment to 
user-centric design and accessible interfaces. 
Beyond my technical skills, I’m deeply interested in GenAI technologies and have worked with 
LLMs, Langchain, and Huggingface, reflecting my eagerness to explore emerging trends. I’ve 
also completed a DSA course by Abdul Bari, further strengthening my problem-solving 
capabilities. 
I am seeking an opportunity where I can contribute meaningfully to innovative projects, grow as 
a software developer, and collaborate with a team that values learning, creativity, and impact. I 
am confident that my background in web technologies, problem-solving, and team collaboration 
makes me a strong fit for your team. 
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to further discuss how 
my skills and enthusiasm align with your goals. I am available at your convenience for an 
interview. 
Warm regards,​
 Shruti Pathak
