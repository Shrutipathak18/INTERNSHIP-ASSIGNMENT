 Hiring Manager​
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
Dear Hiring Manager, 
I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering role at JPMorgan. As a final-year 
B.Tech student in Electronics & Computer Science at KIIT University with a CGPA of 7.97, I am 
passionate about solving real-world problems through technology and have built a solid 
foundation in full-stack development, algorithms, and system design. 
Through my hands-on projects—like building CartMapper, a smart shopping assistant with 
QR-based navigation and multilingual voice support using React, and developing a Database 
Management System with Flask and MySQL—I’ve gained experience working across the stack 
and creating scalable, user-centric applications. My YouTube Sentiment Analysis project, 
which utilizes FastAPI, TextBlob, and Chart.js, allowed me to combine my backend and data 
visualization skills to create an end-to-end web service. 
I have consistently taken the initiative to improve my technical skills, completing a DSA course 
by Abdul Bari, participating in hackathons, and being an active member of E-CELL’s tech team. I 
thrive in collaborative environments, communicate effectively, and stay focused on details while 
always keeping the bigger picture in mind. 
I’m drawn to JPMorgan not just for its innovative tech stack and global impact but also for the 
learning opportunities it provides to young engineers. I’m excited about the possibility of 
contributing to projects that make a real difference at scale and growing in a team that values 
innovation, diversity, and resilience. 
I hope you consider my application . I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my 
background and interests align with JPMorgan’s vision. I’m available for an interview at your 
convenience. 
Warm regards,​
 Shruti Pathak
